<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* Customers need to be able to go into the shop and get items
* The shop needs to total the value of a customers cart
* It also needs to make sure the tax values are correct based on the department

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>

* Started out by writing base classes and test code for making sure values are being created correctly
* Going to write test functions to make sure values are passed correctly
* Try and break out as much functionality into classes as logically possible 
* The finish should be writing the main class and instantiation of multiple customers getting items from the store and checking out

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>

* Writing tests first has made the process slower but i have stronger expectations of what the functions should do
* Breaking out the funcionality into seperate classes has eased the process of coming up with functions
